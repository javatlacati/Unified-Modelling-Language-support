            Describe the overall architecture. 
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
   The UML project is really a modeling project.  One of the things (and currently the only thing) that we can model is UML.  The tool is broken up into three areas Core, Language Framework, and UI. <br>
   
<br>
   
<h3>Modeling Core</h3>The Core contains the meta data layer, workspace management, event framework, preference framework, type management, generative framework, and a add-in framework.  Below is a brief description to each of the components for the tool.  When reading the descriptions keep in mind that the UML tool was originally designed as an application that can be embedded into other application shells. So, some of the components listed are duplicates of NetBeans components. <br>
   
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Meta Data Layer</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The meta data layer is based on the UML specification.  Our data for the most part follows the UML specification.  The interesting thing about UML 2.0 is that the architects of UML 2.0 also designed MOF 2.0.  So at this point UML 2.0 is a super set of MOF 2.0.  When ever a meta data element has a value changed the event framework is used to notify listeners of the change.  The only business rules that the meta data layer applies are to force the correct structure data structure.  The applications business rules are applied by other components in response to events sent out when a model element is about to be modified.  We call these events pre events.  For example when the name of a class model element is changed a name change event is sent and round trip listens for name change events and verify that the name is a valid identifier for the languages associated with the model element.</p>
</blockquote>
   
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Workspace Management</strong>
</li>
</ul>

   
<blockquote>
<p>Describe was design be able to have multiple UML projects open at the same time.  The job of the workspace management component was to manage the projects that are open.  NetBeans 4.x  has its own workspace management facilities.  In Coke we will probably no longer have a dependency on this component.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Event Framework</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The event framework is a component that does not have any dependencies to the rest of the application.  However most of the rest of the tool has dependencies on the EventFramework  We did not use the Java Bean event mechanisms, instead we used more of an event bus mechanism.  The event mechanism is broken into event dispatchers, and event listeners.  The event dispatchers are used to register listeners for events and to send events to all registered listeners.  There is a number of different types of dispatchers in the tool (for example ElementChangeEventDispatcher, AddinEventDispatcher, ElementLifeTimeEventDispatcher etc)  and any component can create a new event dispatcher.  The component that would like to register for an event retrieves the dispatcher and registers for the event.  

    The big difference between our event mechanism and the JavaBeans event mechanism is that you do not have to wait for a component to be created before registering for the events.  For example with the JavaBean event mechanism you have to have an instance of the bean that you wish to register with.  So, if you want to receive notification from all class elements in the system you have to first register for an event to notify you when a class comes into memory, register for the event with the class and then  you are able to receive events. 

	 With the event bus concept the component retrieves the event dispatchers when the component is created, registers for the event and waits.  Whenever something any class changes the registered listener will be notified.</p>
</blockquote>
    
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Preference Framework</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Again Describe was designed to be an application that could be embedded into many shells.  As such we have our own preference framework.  We may want to start using the NetBeans preference mechanism in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
   
   
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Type Management</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Type management is used to quickly find type in the system.  Type management is also the component that makes version control possible.  When  model element is versioned we remove the model element information from the project and replace it with a stub.  The removed information is then gets stored into its own file (.ext) that can be version controlled.  When a versioned model element is referenced the Type Management component make sure that the information in the version controlled file is read in to memory and replaces the stub with the information in the version control  file.  In this way we are able to lazy load information.</p>
</blockquote>
   
   
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Generative Framework</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The generative framework is used to format data.  Basically we are able to use scripts to format information.  The scripts are used to format the information in the diagram, project tree,  and property editor.  In the C++ version of  Describe the generative framework was also used to generate code.</p>
</blockquote>
   
   
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add-In Framework</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Again since Describe was designed to embed into different shell we also developed our own add in framework. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>

   
<br>
   
<h3>Langauge Facility</h3>The language facility supplies the language processing of the modeling tool.  The modeling tool was design to maximize the reuse of the components across languages.  In the modeling domain when we use the term language we are talking about anything that can be generated.  It could be used to generate a source file, XML or a StarOffice document the framework does not care.  The language facility contains the parsers, reverse engineering, method body reverse engineering, round trip framework, and code generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[&lt;/html&gt;]
   <ul>
<li>
<strong>Language Parsers</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The parsers that we use in the UML tool generate events.  The events are structured using UML syntax (actually they are XMI fragments).  Because we use UML as our event syntax all parser listeners are able to be language agnostic because the structure of the event will look the same if the language is Java, C++, C#, VB, JSP, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the parser information and integrates the information into a modeling project. The modeling project can be a new project or an existing project.  Note that there is only one Reverse Engineering component that can handle all of the languages.  Basically it is language agnostic. </p>
</blockquote> 
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Method Body Reverse Engineering</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Takes the parser information and integrates the information into the modeling project by creating an interaction (Sequence Diagram, or Collaboration Diagram) that represents the parser information.  Note that there is only one Method Body Reverse Engineering component that supports all of the languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Round Trip</strong>
</li>
</ul>

   
<blockquote>
<p>Round trip has two purposes in life: one enforce business rules that apply to languages, two notify the code generation that something changed that affect the associated source file artifacts.  Round trip registers for many of the events that can be issued from the meta data, validates the data and applies business rules.  After the data changes have been applied round trip sends an event via the RoundTripEventDispatcher to notify listeners that the source file artifact may need to be updated.  Round trip is not actually responsible for generating any code.  Code generation is the responsibility of the round trip listeners.

   To apply the business rules for a language round trip uses a component called a request process to apply the rules.  Each supported language supplies a request processor.  So the request processor is not language agnostic, however round trip (which only manages the request processors) is language agnostic.  A configuration file is used to determine the request processor to use for a specific language.

   Round trip was designed to allow multiple languages to be associated with one model element.  So a model element can be associated with Java, and WSDL and the code can be generated for each language.  When the model element is changed the code will be generated for both languages without any interaction by the user. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Code Generation</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>Code generation (you guessed it) is used to generate code.  In Java Studio Enterprise the Java code generator uses the NetBeans API to generate code.  However, that does not have to be the case.  As mentioned earlier the C++ version of Describe the code generation module to use the generative framework to generate code.

   The code generation component is registered as a round trip listener for a specific language.  Therefore the Java code generation component only recieves events when a Java source artifact is associated with a model element that has been modified.  When something occurs in the model that affects a source artifact the code generation component is notified via round trip events.  The code generation module then updates the source file. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>
   
<br>
   
<h3>Modeling User Interface</h3>The interfaces provides many visual components to allow the user to interact with a model.  Below is a description of the user interfaces components.<ul>
<li>
<strong>Drawing Area</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The drawing area component is used to render the diagrams  The drawing area control wrapes the <a href="./Wiki?Tom+Sawyer+Libraries" shape="rect">Tom Sawyer</a> components. The drawing area control is a generic control that can be used to when developing any modeling diagram.  Even though the UML product has multiple diagram types there is only one drawing area control for all the diagrams. 
   <br>
<br>
   
<i>INSERT A DIAGRAM HERE</i>

   
</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
    
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Property Elements/Property Definitions</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   The modeling tool has a concept of property elements and property definitions.  Property definitions a basically a meta language that can be used to describe the structure of properties.  The property definitions specify the details of a property.  The property definition fields are listed below.
   
   <br>
<br>
   Property elements is an instance of the property defintions. The property elements contain the properties data and a pointer to the property definitions that specifies the property elements rules.

   The property elements and property definitions are defined as interfaces so there are unlimited posibilities of how to load up the property elements data and how to build the property defintion tree.
   <br>
<br>
   The modeling tool supplies one implementation of the property elements and property defintions that can be built a runtime based on an XML files.  The propety definition file specifies the structure of the property definitions and the property element file specifies all the informtion that is needed to set and retrieve the property data.  Reflection is used to set and retrieve the property data.
   
   
   <ul>
<li>
<strong>Propertery Editor</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   
<blockquote>
<p>The property editor is a generic property editor that uses the property elements/property definitions mentioned above to build property data.  Since the property definitions can contain children the property editor was design to display properties in a tree structure.	</p>

<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
   We have a few hundred JUnit test that we currently run during our release 
   engineering process.  As we move forward we will be building more JUNIT test
   that will be executed.  
   
   Our quality assurance team is in the process of building suite of automated 
   test modules to test the UI components.  We have also instructed the quality 
   assurance team that once the UI test are completed that when a new is written 
   we also want a automated test that engineering can run to replicate the problem.
   By having our quality assurance team assist in the automated test genreation 
   we will be able to have a high rate of successfully replicating issues as
   well as have a higher number of automated test.

<b>Answer:</b>

   To perform DnD between the project tree and the diagrams we use a transferable that 
   keeps track of the model elements that are selected.  We provide our own data flavor
   that can be used to retrieve the model elements that are the target of the operation.
   <br>

   The transferable also implements the string flavor that can be used to pass the 
   model element information.  The string format is a XML string.

   We use the same transferable when performing the copy and paste operations.

<!--
        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
